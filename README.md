# Tidy Data Frame Assignment

The purpose of this assignment was to read in fragmented data, merge the data together, and then clean up the data.  

## Data

The data for this assignment can be obtained on the following website along with a description of the experiment which was performed: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

## Usage

To run the run_analysis.R script, the data first needs to be downloaded and unzipped.  The 'dplyr' package is also required to run the script.  By the end of the script a data frame which matches tidy_avg.csv will be produced.
